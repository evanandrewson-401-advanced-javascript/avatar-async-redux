# Steps

1. Scaffolded out redux
  * created an empty combineReducer
  * created a store
  * we used Provider in index.js
2. Create presentational components (how it looks) - **look at the screen to make sure**
3. created a useful reducer and added it to combineReducer (what data?) **unit test**
4. created action-creators and added those events to our reducer (how does it change) **unit test**
5. created a selector to get relevant data (what specific data does my component need) **unit test**
6. container (tie it together) - **your done look at your screen**
